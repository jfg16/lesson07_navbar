        <h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <p>
            Any good public relations professional knows "any PR is good PR" but is that truly correct? Especially when you're dealing with human rights and fighting for equality? Does multimedia hinder or assist social issues and movements?

            Social media are computer-mediated technologies that facilitate the creation and sharing of information, ideas, career interests and other forms of expression via virtual communities and networks. The variety of stand-alone and built-in social media services currently available introduces challenges of definition; however, there are some common features:
            <ul>
                <li>Social media are interactive Web 2.0 Internet-based applications.</li>
                <li>User-generated content, such as text posts or comments, digital photos or videos, and data generated through all online interactions, are the lifeblood of social media.</li>
                <li>Users create service-specific profiles for the website or app that are designed and maintained by the social media organization.</li>
                <li>Social media facilitate the development of online social networks by connecting a user's profile with those of other individuals or groups.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            Social media activism presents sociologists with the opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of how groups form and sustain collective identities around political issues throughout the course of a social movement. Social media activism – the use of social network technology to organize and coordinate real-world action – shapes how people engage in political protest and how researchers come to understand social movements

            An argument is that the seemingly democratizing impact of online activism is not due to the inherent nature of social media as a tool for democracy but rather an outcome of the equilibrium of forces that shaped the use of social media platforms by all three main players. Activists, governments, and social media firms formed a triangle of powers that influenced the use of social media during the Arab movements. In a different context, the outcome of such power balance can arguably inhibit citizens’ rights and empower governments. To this end, the chapter first explores the use of social media platforms from the perspective of activists, governments, and social media firms, then presents a framework to understand the impact of all three in shaping the use of social media during the uprisings.

            William Gamson argues four social psychological processes are relevant to social movements. Micromobilization includes interactions that link individual and sociocultural factors to the other three processes. Consciousness refers to how individuals construct a shared definition for a social situation that implies collective action. Solidarity refers to how individuals develop and reinforce loyalty and commitment to the groups and organizations that act on behalf of the social movement. Lastly, collective identity involves connection between the self and cultural systems as individuals develop a sense of self relative to the definition of co-participants in an effort toward social change. We extend the literature on the social psychology of collective action using intersectionality as a theoretical framework.
